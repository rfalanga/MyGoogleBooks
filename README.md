# Book Finder
Notes on the Book Finder app for my interview with Sandia National Labs.

## Preparation
I'd never worked with the Google Book API before, so I spent 
time reading about it and experimenting with it, to learn how to
perform a search with the Google Book API. This was done in
a separate, console project.

### Architectual changes
I'm going to create another project to put the Google Book API code into

## The basic app
The basic instrunctions were to prepare an app that allowed a user
to search for books either by author or title. Naturally, other
options could also be done, but for now I'm going to focus upon 
those two

## Initial approach
I'll have two pages, one for searching by author, the other 
for searching by title. I'm chosing this approach because at the 
moment I'm not sure how to restrict the search by one and not the 
other, if the user enters both author and title.

In a later version allowing the user to search both by author
and title would be useful.
